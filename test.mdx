# Main Heading (H1)

This is a regular paragraph with **bold text**, _italic text_, ~~strikethrough~~, <u>underline</u>, and `inline code`. You can also combine them like **_bold and italic_** or `**bold code**`.

## Text Formatting (H2)

Here's a paragraph with a [link to Google](https://google.com) and some H<sub>2</sub>O with subscript and E=mc<sup>2</sup> with superscript.

You can highlight ==important text== like this.

### Lists (H3)

**Unordered list:**

- First item
- Second item with `inline code`
- Third item with **bold**
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
- Fourth item

**Ordered list:**

1. First step
2. Second step with _emphasis_
3. Third step with `code`
4. Fourth step

#### Mixed nested lists (H4)

1. First ordered item
   - Nested bullet
   - Another bullet
2. Second ordered item
   1. Nested ordered
   2. Another ordered

##### Code Blocks (H5)

Here's a JavaScript code block:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  return true;
}
```

Here's a bash code block:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Plain code block with no language:

```
Just plain text
No syntax highlighting
```

###### Blockquotes (H6)

> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines.
>
> And have multiple paragraphs.

## Custom MDX Components

### Card Component

<Card title="Getting Started" icon="rocket" href="/docs/intro">
  This is a card component with a title, icon, and link. Cards are great for
  showcasing features or linking to important pages.
</Card>

<Card title="API Reference" icon="code" iconcolor="blue">
  Another card without an href. Just informational content goes here.

You can have multiple paragraphs inside!

</Card>

### Steps Component
